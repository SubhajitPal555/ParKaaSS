## Description

ParKaaSS is a solution for the smart parking system.

- As we can see in many busy parking spaces, it is a tedious job to find an available spot to park a car.
- So in this project, we will detect parking spots in the main live stream along with a skeleton view of which and how many spots are available.
- The results will be again displayed in a giant screen that will give the drivers a better overview which nearest spot is available.
- The object detection is done by checking the frame counts at every given instance. The free parking spaces generally has a lower frame count than rest.
- Real time data is stored in a pickle object that is created which eventually results to store the positions in which the cars are parked.

#### Technologies

- Object Detection (openCV)
- MASK RCNN
- Tensorflow
- Python libraries (numpy, pickle)
- TwilioAPI
- ResNet
- ffmpeg protocol
